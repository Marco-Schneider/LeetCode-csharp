This repository contains my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. The solutions for each problem were implemented in C#12 | .NET 8. On top of the solutions, unit testing was used to check for validity of each solution before submission, these tests are also executed each time a new push to the main branch is made.
